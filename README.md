A repo containing solution to various problems from different coding platforms.


## Overview

This repository is merely a personal hook to keep me motivated (and, ofcourse, to add more substance to my resume ;)). A perpetual effort to contain the solutions to many challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and other platforms.

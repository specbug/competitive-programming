# Contributing Guidelines

> The objective is to use this repo, as a reward system, to sustain your programming momentum (and passion ðŸ™‚).

## TODOs
1. An index table to link the problem source to the solution files ([example](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming/blob/master/index.md)).
2. Other competetive programming platforms.
3. A resources dir to learn programming.
4. Solutions to more challenges.
5. Any creative stuff you can think of!

## Submissions
1. For new items or modifications, submit a pull request here ([learn how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)).
2. For any bug fixes or suggestions, [create an issue](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming/issues/new).

## Rules
You can share your solutions under the project, if you abide by the following points:
1. Do not paste problem statements / test-cases / descriptions of any kind (to prevent open-sourcing any paid (or private) resource).
2. Please make sure you only upload working solutions.
3. This is not a "learning programming" space ï¹£ you can only post solutions to some competitive programming challenge (of any difficulty level).
4. You can either create a table to link to the problem source (see TODOs), or structure your project such that your filenames links to the source with a simple Google search.
5. Make sure your code is in-line with the submission format for that particular source.
